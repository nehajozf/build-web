  <h2> Name: Neha Joseph </h2>
  <h2> Candidate No: KJ2119 </h2>
  <h2> Subject: CM 1040  Web Development </h2>

<h3> Introduction - </h3>
<p> The article that I created is about Adoption of Dogs. People say a mans best friend is a dog; and that is so true.
    My favourite animal is a dog. I have a pet dog which is my best friend. I chose the topic Adoption of dogs because there are many dogs in the world that are
    euthanized. About 8 to 12 million dogs are euthanized all over the world. I actually adopted my dog from a foundation which I found through a website.
    And because of that reason I adopted my dog who became my best friend.</p>

<p> This concept gave me an idea to create a website aritcle based on Adoption of Dogs. In the website that I created, I have listed
    5 types of dogs that are available for adoption. I have listed the things like the personality of dogs, their life expectancy,
    their height, weight etc. I have also listed the contact information of my website like the address and the phone number.
    In each webpage, I have implemented different layout structures with pictures and information about
    the 5 different types of dogs. The last page of my website is the contact us page in which we can write a message to the
    given admins about adopting a dog. </p>


<h3> Inspiration - </h3>
<p>The first and most important thing that inspired me to create my website is my pet dog.</p>

<p>The idea behind to create my website is the other websites on Adoption of dogs which has inspired me to
   care for other dogs and to help them have a home and a loving family. </p>

<p> Artists and celebrities also inspired me and have given awareness to people all around the world
   to care for dogs and try to adopt them or provide shelter with necessary facilities. </p>


<h3> Accessibility - </h3>
<p>In my website, I have implemented the use of headings correctly to organize the structure of my content
   which can easily be interpretted by people with difficulties. </p>

<p> I have also inculded proper alt text for images in my website so that users can understand the message
   conveyed by the use of images on the page.</p>

<p> I have used colors with care in my website so that users with learning disabilities,
   benefit greatly from color when used to distinguish and organize the content. </p>

<h3> Usability - </h3>
<p> The first usability of my website is that my website is responsive, which means, it can be viewed on
    a computer or any different size of phones </p>

<p>My website has used the usability of clarity. If many users are confused or distracted in the website,
   they need more time to find for what they came for. My site is simple and focuses on what is important. </p>

<p> My website is credible. The contents in my website are true and precise. </p>

<h3> Learning - </h3>

<p> I learned that in order to create a website, one must define the sites purpose and strategy.
    We must define the purpose of the site and how helpful it is. </p>

<p>Next, we should research on the latest web design trends. Nowdays, users search for websites that
  are appealing to their eyes. By implementing the latest web designs on our website, the users would have more interest. </p>

<p> I have also learned that we should add in and optimize our content. We should provide proper information which is simple
    to understand by users. We should also add pictures or videos to enhance our website. </p>

<p> (Links of the sites I used will be listed at resources) </p>

<h3> Evaluation I - </h3>

<p> I was successful in the idea of my website. I knew what I wanted to convey in my website. I was successful in the clarity of the contents
    I wanted to show in my website. I was successful in the structure of my website as my website was simple and understandable by people of all ages
    and people with certain difficulties. I have added alot of pictures to my website look more understandable. My website  engages with the users,
    hold their attention, direct them through the stages of my website and finally encourage them to contact me. </p>


<h3> Evaluation II - </h3>

<p> I think I could have improved the template of my web page. I could have removed distractions,complicated animations, from my website.
    I could have  abundantly cleared what your user will learn on my page they are viewing and my design must not distract them from this.
    I could have organized my navigation more better. It is essentially the map that displays the core places users can visit. It is how users
    can easily dive deeper into areas of my services </p>
