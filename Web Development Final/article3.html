               <h5>About Pug Dog</h5>
               <p>
                 They range in height from 10 to 11 inches and in weight from 14 to 18 pounds (six to eight kilograms). They are square dogs with substantial limbs. Pugs are the sturdiest dogs of the toy group, befitting their mastiff heritage.
                 Pugs are known for their large, round heads, with the shortened muzzles and extensive forehead wrinkles. The vertical wrinkle on the forehead is said to resemble the Chinese character for "prince" and thus known as the "prince mark." The eyes protrude somewhat, making them prone to trauma. The tail curls tightly over the hip.
               </p>
               <p>
                  They have a short, but very dense double coat. Colors can range from apricot to fawn, silver and black. All but the black dogs have a dark mask and ears with a trace of darkening down the back. The ears feel like black velvet.
                  The word "pug" may come from the Latin "pugnus" for fist, possibly describing the round face and head. The name does not fit the breed's temperament, because these are not really guard dogs, but designed first and foremost as companion dogs.

                  It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

               <h5>Living with Pug Dogs</h5>
               <p>
                  Pugs are extremely easy to keep and have a serious tendency to become obese unless their diet and exercise are watched carefully.
                  With the short muzzle, they do not do well in hot, humid weather and must be observed carefully for heatstroke. Pugs do tend to snore, again a result of the short muzzle.
                  The prominent eyes are easily injured and care must be taken to keep them moist. Pugs are fairly robust and often live to 14 or 15 years of age.
               </p>

               <p>
                 Pugs do best with some daily exercise to help with their weight problems. Despite their heroic alarm years ago, they are not usually great watchdogs, preferring instead to greet newcomers with a wagging tail.
                 Pugs should be socialized to keep that outgoing temperament, and they do well with other pets.
                 Grooming is important, both for the shedding from the dense coat and to keep facial wrinkles clean. A quick daily grooming, even a swipe with a hound mitt, usually suffices for the coat and a gentle wiping with a wet cloth for the face.
